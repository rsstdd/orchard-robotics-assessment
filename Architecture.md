- **Frontend:** The React-based web application that users interact with.
- **Flask API:** The backend API built with Flask that handles user requests, communicates with the SQL database, and performs calculations.
- **SQL Database:** The database where fruit data and relevant information are stored.
- **Redis Cache:** A caching system to optimize and speed up data retrieval and reduce the load on the database.
  - *User Sessions:* Store user session data in Redis to manage user authentication and authorization efficiently. This can help speed up the process of verifying user access and permissions.
  - *Frequently Accessed Data:* Identify datasets that are frequently queried by users or the application. Caching this data in Redis can significantly reduce database queries, resulting in faster response times. For example, you might cache common fruit data, such as fruit names, types, or nutritional information.
  - *Search Results:* If your application includes a search functionality for fruits or orchards, you can cache search results based on user queries. This minimizes the need to re-run the same queries against the database for identical searches.
  - *Aggregated Data:* If you provide statistics or reports based on fruit data, consider caching aggregated results. For instance, you might cache daily or monthly fruit sales totals, average nutritional values, or other computed metrics.
  - *API Responses:* Cache the responses of frequently used API endpoints. This is especially useful if you have read-heavy endpoints that return static or semi-static data.
  - *Orchard and Fruit Details:* Store details about orchards, such as location, owner information, and fruit variety details. Caching this information can help reduce database queries when displaying orchard or fruit details to users.
  - *Images:* If your application serves images, like fruit photos or scans, consider caching these images in Redis to minimize the load on your storage system and improve image retrieval times.
  - *Frequently Executed Queries:* Cache the results of complex or resource-intensive database queries that are frequently executed. This can help alleviate the load on the database and improve query performance.
- **Cloud Storage:** A storage solution for storing images, data, or other assets.
- **AI Model for Image Processing:** An AI model that processes images, performs object detection, and extracts data from scans.

### Explanation of Key Components:
- *Data Source:* This is where data is initially generated or collected, such as through cameras or sensors.
- *Data Ingest & Capture:* Data from the source is ingested and captured for further processing. This may involve capturing images of fruit.
- *Data Preprocessing & Cleansing:* Raw data is preprocessed to remove noise, handle missing values, and cleanse it for analysis. For images, this may include enhancement techniques like resizing and filtering.
- *Feature Extraction:* Features relevant to fruit maturity assessment are extracted from the preprocessed data. This may involve analyzing color, size, shape, and other characteristics.
- *Data Integration & Aggregation:* Extracted features are integrated and aggregated to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis. Machine learning models and algorithms may be applied at this stage.
- *Analytics & Algorithms:* This step involves running analytics and applying algorithms to assess fruit maturity. Machine learning models can classify fruit based on their maturity level.
- *Data Storage & Management:* Data related to matured fruits may be stored for future reference or reporting.
- *Quality Control & Validation:* Quality control checks ensure data accuracy and consistency. Duplicate or anomalous data may be flagged.
- *Visualization:* Results and assessments are visualized, often through dashboards, charts, and reports.
- *Reporting & Alerts:* Detailed reports on fruit maturity assessments can be generated. Alerts may be triggered based on specific conditions.
